# Objective
Developed an analytics solution for Optus Customer Churn. This prediction model aims to identify factors that drive customer churn and reveal characteristics of customer clusters likely to churn. This solution is achieved by analysing the effectiveness of current marketing campaigns, identifying clusters who are persuadables, promote brand loyalty and present value-adding retention strategies (i.e. Fostering customer relationships, Curating package incentives, Telemarketing communciation channels etc.)

# Insights and Recommended Retention Strategies 
1. In this particular cluster, majority of customers are not on a contract with high proportion of churn rate
- Target advertising to this cluster through retail, business channels and mass markets
 
2. In another cluster, there are customers with historical tendencies to recontract
- To promote brand loyalty, offering a small incentive to renew instead of recontracting (i.e. Add 1GB of data to existing plan, cross-sell of another Optus service like Optus Sport etc)

3. Curated a customized plan "Pick & Pay"
- Opportunity for customers to customize their plan on a quarterly basis, targeted towards younger customers
